Hello, and welcome to the ZDL (Zeepkist Difficulty List) web data repository!
We rank the hardest maps in Zeepkist, and keep track of who's the best at beating those maps.
Because this is here, if you want to make the ZDL Toolkist website more up to date, you can make a pull/merge request with changes to the JSON file that it uses.
The ZDL website in question can be found here: https://toolkist.netlify.app/zdl
The google spreadsheet (often the most up to date copy of the ZDL): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DekRtBjE2P83hpAcgjvcqSILjMFuouI0I7hSA7SpmhA
